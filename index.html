                First and foremost, you have to understand what you can actually
                afford. In Switzerland, your affordability limit depends on two
                factors: the amount of savings that you have and your regular
                income. BTW... Did you know that you do not need to present 20%
                of the property price as a down payment? You can actually
                finance up to 10% of the property price with your pension
                savings. Unlike in other countries, using pension savings to
                increase the maximum purchase price is quite common in
                Switzerland and many people do it!
              </p>

              <p>
                Beware of hidden costs like notary fees and issuance of mortgage
                certificates which are often overlooked by buyers. In some
                cantons, these fees may amount up to 5% of the property price
                and are not covered by a mortgage (meaning you have to pay it
                out of your own pocket at the time of purchase).
              </p>
