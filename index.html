                First and foremost, you have to understand what you can actually
                afford. In Switzerland, your affordability limit depends on two
                factors: the amount of savings that you have and your regular
                income. BTW... Did you know that you do not need to present 20%
                of the property price as a down payment? You can actually
                finance up to 10% of the property price with your pension
                savings. Unlike in other countries, using pension savings to
                increase the maximum purchase price is quite common in
                Switzerland and many people do it!
              </p>

              <p>
                Beware of hidden costs like notary fees and issuance of mortgage
                certificates which are often overlooked by buyers. In some
                cantons, these fees may amount up to 5% of the property price
                and are not covered by a mortgage (meaning you have to pay it
                out of your own pocket at the time of purchase).
              </p>

                You can check your affordability range easily with Hyppo.CH to
                get a basic idea of the price range that you should be looking
                at. We also reveal hidden fees to give you a complete picture of
                the costs that you have to be ready for.

                Proof of funding (or “Finanzierungsbestätigung” in German)
                indicates your financial solvency. Imagine that you have
                invested hours in online research and suddenly you have found
                the right property! Excited about your progress you decide to
                call the agent for an appointment. And… bummer! You are not the
                only one that is interested and they inform you that there will
                be an "open house" date where you can compete with many other
                interested parties and place your offer. This is a common
                situation in Switzerland. To increase your chances of securing
                the property, you have to be prepared. The proof of funding
                provides you with an advantage and shows that you are capable of
                the financial commitment that is required by the asking price.
                This document is often required by real estate agencies before
                they can start evaluating your case.
