                First and foremost, you have to understand what you can actually
                afford. In Switzerland, your affordability limit depends on two
                factors: the amount of savings that you have and your regular
                income. BTW... Did you know that you do not need to present 20%
                of the property price as a down payment? You can actually
                finance up to 10% of the property price with your pension
                savings. Unlike in other countries, using pension savings to
                increase the maximum purchase price is quite common in
                Switzerland and many people do it!
              </p>

              <p>
                Beware of hidden costs like notary fees and issuance of mortgage
                certificates which are often overlooked by buyers. In some
                cantons, these fees may amount up to 5% of the property price
                and are not covered by a mortgage (meaning you have to pay it
                out of your own pocket at the time of purchase).
              </p>

                You can check your affordability range easily with Hyppo.CH to

                Proof of funding (or “Finanzierungsbestätigung” in German)
                indicates your financial solvency. Imagine that you have
                invested hours in online research and suddenly you have found
                the right property! Excited about your progress you decide to
                call the agent for an appointment. And… bummer! You are not the
                only one that is interested and they inform you that there will
                be an "open house" date where you can compete with many other
                interested parties and place your offer. This is a common
                situation in Switzerland. To increase your chances of securing
                the property, you have to be prepared. The proof of funding
                provides you with an advantage and shows that you are capable of
                the financial commitment that is required by the asking price.

                Now that you know what you can afford, it’s time to look for
                properties. Whether you’re looking for a house or an apartment,
                you should create a crystal clear image of what you want. Think
                about ideal size, location, surroundings and of course aesthetic
                and practical aspects. Deal with these questions honestly and as
                uninfluenced as possible by friends or trends. This compass will
                make it easier for you to search and decide for or against a
                property. Here are the links to the most popular real estate
                portals in Switzerland. We suggest checking multiple portals
                since some of the listings have exclusive publishing agreements
                with a particular site: https://homegate.ch
                https://immoscout24.ch https://immowelt.ch You can also hire a
                real estate agent. Once you have found a suitable property, you
                go to an inspection and/or request documentation from the
                seller.

              <p>
                A property evaluation (or “Liegenschaftsbewertung” in German)
                can be requested from a bank in order to evaluate whether the
                property you are considering is worth its selling price. Each
                bank wants to understand the value of a property before granting
                a mortgage and this should be your ambition too! Why?
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's say the home of your dreams is available and you are ready
                for the next step – the price negotiation (yes, there is always
                room for that and it’s a normal part of the purchase process!).
                Now you need valid arguments. Market value is going to provide
                you with exactly that. It will also take future renovations into
                consideration and give you a great idea of what you will have to
                invest down the road. Listing those costs and confronting the
                seller with those details leverages your position massively. Be
                prepared!

                Once you have found a property that you like and really want to
                buy, you can reserve the property. It is not uncommon in
                Switzerland for a seller to ask for a small amount to be paid
                upfront (usually around 5% of the property price). This amount
                will later be counted toward the down payment and will guarantee
                that no one else can buy your dream home.

                Once you have been awarded the contract by the seller, both of
                you will go to the notary to prepare the necessary contractual
                documents. At the same time, you conclude the mortgage contract
                with the financing bank and receive an irrevocable financing
                confirmation. After this, you and the seller go to the notary
                again and both parties sign the purchase contract so you become
                the official owner. You then send a copy of the signed purchase
                contract to your lender. Since the mortgage and purchase
                contracts are interdependent, you may have to conclude the
                mortgage contract before the purchase contract.
